A hearing in federal court in San Diego is set for Thursday, and the trial is scheduled to begin on Nov. 28, barring any delays or if Trump decides to settle the case.    While presidents enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that this shield does not extend to acts alleged to have taken place prior to taking office. The 1997 ruling came in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against President Bill Clinton by Paula Jones, which was settled before it went to trial.  Lawyers said they could think of no similar situation like the one now involving Trump. \\u201cI\\u2019m certain there is nothing comparable to this,\\u201d said    Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School.  Lawyers for both Trump and the plaintiffs declined to comment on Wednesday. Dershowitz said the Supreme Court also held that a case cannot be delayed just because the defendant is president, though judges are still free to grant reasonable delays to any party. Miami trial consultant Sandy Marks, who is not involved in the case, said he thought Trump might ask the presiding judge, Gonzalo Curiel, to postpone the trial in an effort to settle the case before taking office. \\u201cI think the judge would be foolhardy not to give him a short (delay),\\u201d said Marks, \\u201cwhich would give him a chance to resolve the case with all these people and put it behind him.\\u201d Trump repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he would win the lawsuit, and he accused Curiel of being biased against him because of his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. At the hearing on Thursday, lawyers will argue pre-trial motions, including one by Trump to block potential jurors from hearing comments made or publicized during the campaign, such as those about the judge. Lawyers for the students have argued the comments could help jurors assess Trump\\u2019s credibility as a witness. Trump is listed as defense witness in the case and could be called to testify by the plaintiffs as well. He was previously deposed by the students\\u2019 lawyers.  Claims against Trump over the seminars date to 2010, with two class actions filed in federal court in San Diego and another case brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on behalf of students who claim they were misled into paying as much as $35,000 each to learn worthless real estate investing \\u201csecrets\\u201d from instructors \\u201chand-picked\\u201d by Trump. Trump has admitted he did not hand-pick instructors, but has argued the claim was marketing language not meant to be taken literally. He claims most students were happy with their courses.  If the trial goes forward, several legal experts said it would be hard to seat an impartial jury, since so many people already have strong opinions about the president-elect. Parties often hire specialized jury consultants to pick jurors, but New York lawyer Robert Anello said they were not infallible. \\u201cIf experienced pollsters can\\u2019t get it right,\\u201d he said, \\u201chow can a jury consultant who is not spending as much time studying the demographics?\\u201d In an interview a day before the election, Jeffrey Goldman, a lawyer for Trump in the New York case, said the media\\u2019s \\u201cdrumbeat of distortion\\u201d about Trump University would make it hard to find impartial jurors. Several experts noted that jurors, who will answer a questionnaire in addition to being questioned by the lawyers and the judge, are generally taken at their word when they say they can be impartial. Boston jury consultant Edward Schwartz said he expects both sides to make an effort to vet jurors by their public social media postings. Dershowitz noted that San Diego, though located in deep-blue California, is not as politically monolithic as, say, San Francisco. It has an ethnically diverse population and also has a large military presence. \\u201cThis is a jury consultant\\u2019s nightmare to pick in a case like this,\\u201d said Dershowitz. \\u201cIt will be taught in jury consulting school.\\u201d \",\n          \"The alt-right political movement is not something most mainstream voters know much about, but this year it is imperative that they do. This brand of conservativism is one that is disturbing on many levels, and made up of neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and other assorted racist extremists. What s more is that Steve Bannon, head of the insanely bigoted conservative website Breitbart, is now heading up Donald Trump s campaign for president. Therefore, Hillary Clinton is planning to do the people of America a favor this coming Thursday and give a speech educating the people on this fringe movement that is definitely a big player in the Trump campaign.The Clinton campaign says of the speech: This  alt-right  brand is embracing extremism and presenting a divisive and dystopian view of America which should concern all Americans, regardless of party. They go on to remind everyone that Trump s entire campaign staff is made up of people who embrace this bigoted garbage. Indeed, this is something that used to be on the fringes, in the bowels of the interwebs where only basement-dwelling imbeciles who embrace the new white supremacy even knew anything about this largely online  movement. However, Donald Trump has changed all of that, and empowered these dangerous idiots to come into the light. They see him as an inspiration. They have definitely picked up on Trump s dog whistling. After all, we all know that  Make America Great Again,  is really just code for  Make America WHITE Again.  Despite Trump s recent pathetic efforts to reach out to minority voters, we all know what he is REALLY doing   trying to make white people uncomfortable with such blatant racism believe he s just not-racist enough for them to be able to pull the lever for him this November.Thank you, Secretary Clinton, for this public service. Hopefully, people listen.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images\",\n          \"Despite the fact that MSNBC s Morning Joe s main host, Joe Scarborough, is an avowed Republican, the show s hosts and guests from across the political spectrum can t stand Donald Trump. They pull no punches and give his surrogates no breaks. Of course, the tough questions and constant criticism of his fitness for the office he seeks makes The Donald come apart at the seams.On Friday, Trump once again showed just how thin-skinned he is, when he tweeted out a demand for an apology, along with an insult directed at Scarborough s co-host, Mika Brzezskinski, in which he called her  crazy  all for daring to challenge one of his surrogates regarding the racist comments that Trump made about Trump University lawsuit Judge Gonzalo Curiel. Here is the tweet:Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe. Apologize!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2016The conversation to which Trump took such high offense involved a black pastor and ardent Trump supporter Mark Burns. Brzezinski asked Burns:When [Trump] made the comments he made about the judge, saying he was a Mexican, was that racist or not? Of course Trump surrogates, regardless of race, will absolutely not acknowledge that his comments have been racist or that he has been playing footsie with the likes of white supremacists, anti-semites, Ku Klux Klan members and the like. So, of course Burns went on the offensive, saying: If I was in Mr. Trump s shoes, I don t think that it was racist. I understand what real racism is. I m from the South, I m a black man from the Deep South, OK? In South Carolina just two months ago, they re-raised the Confederate flag in my state to celebrate its one year s removal. So for you to sit here and ask me like I don t know what real racism is, I don t think so. Now, as a black woman I don t generally take kindly to white people telling black people how to feel about race, race politics, and racism, but let me tell you, I definitely make an exception when it comes to Uncle Toms. That is what black Trump supporters are. The man has a lengthy and well documented history of racist statements, racist business practices, and associations just from this campaign alone that prove, unequivocally, that even if there is no racism in his head or heart, there s definitely an overt tolerance for racists and racism within the Trump campaign and by Trump himself.Even after Burns was done, Brzezinski continued to hammer Trump, saying, You have no idea   you have no idea what your words mean.  And to top it all off, Scarborough took a shot at Trump for his addiction to Twitter, and to watching his own press coverage:Is Donald Trump crazy? You betcha.Crazy for Morning Joe. The Trump U founder just can't quit us! https://t.co/YG7C7tQNUN  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) August 26, 2016Indeed, it is Trump who is the crazy one here, not Mika. He should be worried about his slipping polls numbers and campaigning rather than feuding with television pundits. Once again, he shows how temperamentally unfit he is to lead this great nation.
